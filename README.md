# Sun-Traking-Solar-Panel
A simple code written in C++ in Arduino Uno IDE to lead your Solar Panel toward the Sun to maximize the energie producing
The System contain a Arduino Uno as a microcontroller, a servo motor so the panel can move and 2 light-sensor to determine the direction of the light
Trough the microcontroller you can find where is the light has its maximum value then command the servo motor and so the solar panels toward the Light meaning the sun 
Addinitional, you can also see the values of the light sensor when you connect a liquid crystal (LCD) to the Arduino uno
